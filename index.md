Most works in recent years are focusing on data-driven methods. If one model doesn't work, we don't need to modify the architecture, instead, feeding more data will solve any problems. 

Deep learning free us from time-consuming feature engineering, but I believe the prior knowledge is still useful. I want to do some work to incorporate prior knowledge into neural networks in NLP tasks. 

Honestly speaking, I am confused of what prior knowledge really means ... I am going to read some papers and try to figure out previous efforts to incorporate prior knowledge.

All the papers I have surveyed will be listed below, and I am going to write some introduction about them one by one. If you find some interesting papers, I will be very grateful if you tell me !!!
